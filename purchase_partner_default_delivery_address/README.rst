=====================================================
Use default delivery address from Vendor in purchases
=====================================================

When choosing a vendor to a purchase, this module automatically picks
the default delivery address from that vendor to its delivery address
field. Note that these are custom fields and not part of standard odoo.

Also note that setting a delivery address works differently in sales.

Configuration
=============
-/

Usage
=====
Set a default delivery address to a vendor. Then create a purchase to
see that its delivery address comes from its vendor.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================
Purchase delivery address is only an informational field.
